
project definition
Air pollution is one of environmental issues that cannot be ignored. Inhaling pollutants
for a long time causes damages in human health. Traditional air quality monitoring methods,
such as building air quality monitoring stations, are typically expensive. This project is
suitable for air quality monitoring in real time. Design a tool which will sense quality of air
and display it in the form of percentage, Sense how much carbon mono-oxide(CO) is present
in air and display in the form of percentage, Sense the temperature and display it in degree
celcius


objectives
In the future work, we can modify the system to notify a user about the air quality when it
reaches beyond when it reaches beyond a permissible level through SMS or APP. Notification,
furthermore, the sensors in the system can be calibrated more so that we can get more accurate
and get data for more harmful gases such as Ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, etc. Our work can
demonstrate vast opportunities to work on the device, on the app and also on the field using
the device that we have worked with. The device can be used any time efficiently in different
locations of a city and then research with the achieved data for that particular area in that city.
The device can be updated with additional sensors that can sense data from the existence of
other gases such as O2 and H2. These gases will provide the condition of the atmosphere and
authority can take into further decisions accordingly. The sensors that we have been worked
with can also be reset according to most recent time update. The android app which we have
developed for turning on and off the device can be updated with newer features by
implementing necessary codes
